# mod-framework

The ModFramework is a suite of building blocks to assist development of applications within OMB's Management and Operations Division (MOD).  The Framework is loosely based on ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP).  

The Mod.Framework.Server projects provide ASP.NET server side tools for creating a RESTful Web API interface with a SQL Server backend.  The Server side code is currently written in .NET core 3.1 and .NET Standard 2.

Client utilities include mod-angular-libraries which provide common layout, menu structure, and authentication for applications.  The angular libraries utilize Angular 11, although, an old dist exists for Angular 9 development as well.
